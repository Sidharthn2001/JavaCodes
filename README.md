This Java program displays the current date and time every 3 seconds in the console and writes it to a file named "timefile.txt". Here's a breakdown of the code:

Import statements: The program imports the necessary classes and interfaces required for the program to run.
CurrentTimeDisplay class: This is the main class that contains the main method.
FILE_PATH constant: This is a constant string that stores the file path of the file where the current date and time will be written.
diplayContent method: This method reads the contents of the file "timefile.txt" and displays it in the console.
main method: This is the entry point of the program. 
It creates a ScheduledExecutorService that runs the loopFunction method every 3 seconds with an initial delay of 0 seconds. 
It then waits for 30 seconds and shuts down the executor service. Finally, it calls the diplayContent method to display the contents of the file in the console.
loopFunction method: This method gets the current date and time, formats it using the SimpleDateFormat class, and displays it in the console. 
It then creates a File object for the file "timefile.txt" and checks if it exists. 
If it doesn't exist, it creates a new file. It then opens a BufferedWriter for the file and writes the current date and time to it.
Overall, this program demonstrates how to use the ScheduledExecutorService to run a task repeatedly at a fixed interval, and how to write to a file using the FileWriter class.
